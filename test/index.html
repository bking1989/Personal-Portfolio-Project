                <p>Hi there! My name is Bradley King, and I am web developer from Tucson, AZ. I have a passion for problem-solving and
                    helping people, and I believe that web development can do both of these things. I believe in using code and various
                    web
                    technologies to help people meet their personal and professional needs.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Prior to entering web development, I studied at the George Washington University, in Washington, DC. In 2012, I
                    graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in international affairs and political science. After graduating, I spent a few
                    years working in the insurance industry as a claims adjuster, before enrolling with the University of Arizona's
                    code boot camp, in 2018. Their intense, comprehensive program helped me expand my coding skills, and get more
                    familiar with a number of languages and technologies, including:</p>
