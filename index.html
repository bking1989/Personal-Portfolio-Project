                    <p>When I graduated university with a degree in international affairs, I knew, right away, that I wanted to make a career solving problems. Later on, my experiences working in industries like insurance and finance helped me discover that I had a passion for helping people, as well. Training with the University of Arizona’s code boot camp helped me discover that I could bring both of these passions together through web development.</p>
                    <p>My time studying with the boot camp helped me hone my skills with HTML, CSS, Javascript, back-end databases, and other technologies that are vital for web solutions in today’s market. I am confident that my expertise with front-end web design, coding back-end applications, and planning out full-stack projects can be valuable for helping my client meet their business and professional needs.</p>
